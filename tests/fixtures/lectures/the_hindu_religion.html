<h2>THE HINDU RELIGION</h2>
<p>My religion is to learn. I read my Bible better in the light
of your Bible and the dark prophecies of my religion become brighter
when compared with those of your prophets. Truth has always been
universal. If I alone were to have six fingers on my hand while all of
you had only five, you would not think that my hand was the true intent
of nature, but rather that it was abnormal and diseased. Just so with
religion. If one creed alone were to be true and all the others untrue,
you would have a right to say that that religion was diseased; if one
religion is true, all the others must be true. Thus the Hindu religion
is your property as well as mine. Of the two hundred and ninety
millions of people inhabiting India, only two millions are Christians,
sixty millions Mohammedans and all the rest are Hindus. </p>
<p>The Hindus found their creed upon the ancient Vedas, a word
derived from Vid, "to know". These are a series of books which, to our
minds, contain the essence of all religion; but we do not think they
alone contain the truths. They teach us the immortality of the soul. In
every country and every human breast there is a natural desire to find
a stable equilibrium &#8212; something that does not change. We cannot find
it in nature, for all the universe is nothing but an infinite mass of
changes. But to infer from that that nothing unchanging exists is to
fall into the error of the Southern school of Buddhists and the
Chârvâkas, which latter believe that all is matter and nothing mind,
that all religion is a cheat, and morality and goodness, useless
superstitions. The Vedanta philosophy teaches that man is not bound by
his five senses. They only know the present, and neither the future nor
the past; but as the present signifies both past and future,<!--'Volume 1 Page 330'-->
and all three are only demarcations of time, the present also would be
unknown if it were not for something above the senses, something
independent of time, which unifies the past and the future in the
present. </p>
<p>But what is independent? Not our body, for it depends upon
outward conditions; nor our mind, because the thoughts of which it is
composed are caused. It is our soul. The Vedas say the whole world is a
mixture of independence and dependence, of freedom and slavery, but
through it all shines the soul independent, immortal, pure, perfect,
holy. For if it is independent, it cannot perish, as death is but a
change, and depends upon conditions; if independent, it must be
perfect, for imperfection is again but a condition, and therefore
dependent. And this immortal and perfect soul must be the same in the
highest God as well as in the humblest man, the difference between them
being only in the degree in which this soul manifests itself. </p>
<p>But why should the soul take to itself a body? For the same
reason that I take a looking-glass &#8212; to see myself. Thus, in the body,
the soul is reflected. The soul is God, and every human being has a
perfect divinity within himself, and each one must show his divinity
sooner or later. If I am in a dark room, no amount of protestation will
make it any brighter &#8212; I must light a match. Just so, no amount of
grumbling and wailing will make our imperfect body more perfect. But
the Vedanta teaches &#8212; call forth your soul, show your divinity. Teach
your children that they are divine, that religion is a positive
something and not a negative nonsense; that it is not subjection to
groans when under oppression, but expansion and manifestation. </p>
<p>Every religion has it that man's present and future are
modified by the past, and that the present is but the effect of the
past. How is it, then, that every child is born with an experience that
cannot be accounted for by<!--'Volume 1 Page 331'-->
hereditary transmission? How is it that one is born of good parents,
receives a good education and becomes a good man, while another comes
from besotted parents and ends on the gallows? How do you explain this
inequality without implicating God? Why should a merciful Father set
His child in such conditions which must bring forth misery? It is no
explanation to say God will make amends; later on &#8212; God has no
blood-money. Then, too, what becomes of my liberty, if this be my first
birth? Coming into this world without the experience of a former life,
my independence would be gone, for my path would be marked out by the
experience of others. If I cannot be the maker of my own fortune, then
I am not free. I take upon myself the blame for the misery of this
existence, and say I will unmake the evil I have done in another
existence. This, then, is our philosophy of the migration of the soul.
We come into this life with the experience of another, and the fortune
or misfortune of this existence is the result of our acts in a former
existence, always becoming better, till at last perfection is reached. </p>
<p>We believe in a God, the Father of the universe, infinite and
omnipotent. But if our soul at last becomes perfect, it also must
become infinite. But there is no room for two infinite unconditional
beings, and hence we believe in a Personal God, and we ourselves are
He. These are the three stages which every religion has taken. First we
see God in the far beyond, then we come nearer to Him and give Him
omnipresence so that we live in Him; and at last we recognise that we
are He. The idea of an Objective God is not untrue &#8212; in fact, every
idea of God, and hence every religion, is true, as each is but a
different stage in the journey, the aim of which is the perfect
conception of the Vedas. Hence, too, we not only tolerate, but we
Hindus accept every religion, praying in the mosque of the Mohammedans,
worshipping before the fire of the Zoroastrians, and kneeling before
the<!--'Volume 1 Page 332'--> cross of the Christians,
knowing that all the religions, from the lowest fetishism to the
highest absolutism, mean so many attempts of the human soul to grasp
and realise the infinite, each determined by the conditions of its
birth and association, and each of them marking a stage of progress. We
gather all these flowers and bind them with the twine of love, making a
wonderful bouquet of worship. </p>
<p>If I am God, then my soul is a temple of the Highest, and my
every motion should be a worship &#8212; love for love's sake, duty for
duty's sake, without hope of reward or fear of punishment. Thus my
religion means expansion, and expansion means realisation and
perception in the highest sense &#8212; no mumbling words or genuflections.
Man is to become divine, realising the divine more and more from day to
day in an endless progress. </p>
