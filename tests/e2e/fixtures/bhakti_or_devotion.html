    <h1>Bhakti or Devotion</h1>
    <p>
      Bhakti is a series of successive steps in the realisation of God. The first is the repetition
      of the name of God. The second is the worship of God as the Soul of all souls. The third is
      the worship of God as the Creator, the Preserver, and the Destroyer of the universe. The
      fourth is the worship of God as the Lord of all, the Father and Mother of all.
