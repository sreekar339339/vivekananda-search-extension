    <h1>The Mission of the Vedanta</h1>
    <p>
      The first thing to do is to get this idea out of your heads. Say, âI am the Atman. I am the
      Self.â Say it to yourselves day and night. Let it be the first thought in the morning and the
      last thought at night. Let it be in your blood, and in your veins, and in your bones. The soul
      is the only reality, and we are that soul. This is the truth. This is the great message of
      Vivekananda.
