    <h1>The Gita I</h1>
    <p>
      The soul is a circle of which the circumference is nowhere, but the centre is located in the
      body, and death means the change of this centre from body to body. Nor is the soul bound by
      the conditions of matter. In its very essence, it is free, unbounded, holy, pure, and perfect.
      But somehow or other it finds itself tied down to matter, and thinks of itself as matter.
