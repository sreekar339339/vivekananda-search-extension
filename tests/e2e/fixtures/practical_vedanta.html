    <h1>Practical Vedanta</h1>
    <p>
      The Vedanta recognizes no sin, it only recognizes error. And the greatest error, says the
      Vedanta, is to say that you are weak, that you are a sinner, a miserable creature, and that
      you have no power and you cannot do this and that. Every soul is a sleeping giant. The first
      step is to know that you are a soul, and that you are not the body.
