    <h1>Women of India</h1>
    <p>
      The ideal of womanhood in India is motherhood â€” that marvellous, unselfish, all-suffering,
      ever-forgiving mother. The wife is the co-partner of her husband in his religious duties and
      spiritual progress. She is his Sahadharmini, his co-religionist. Her soul is one with his
      soul, her life is one with his life.
