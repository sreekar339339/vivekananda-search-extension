    <h1>The Real and the Apparent Man</h1>
    <p>
      The real man is the soul, the apparent man is the body. The soul is not subject to birth and
      death. It is birthless, deathless, and changeless. It is the witness of all the changes in the
      universe. It is the unchanging, the constant, the eternal.
