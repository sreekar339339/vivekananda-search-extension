    <h1>My Master</h1>
    <p>
      My Master, Sri Ramakrishna, used to say, 'The soul is not to be sought in the heavens, nor in
      the depths of the earth, but in the heart of man.' He taught that every soul is potentially
      divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity by controlling nature, external and internal.
