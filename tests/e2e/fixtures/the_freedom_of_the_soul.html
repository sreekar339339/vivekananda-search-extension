    <h1>The Freedom of the Soul</h1>
    <p>
      The soul is not a part of the body; it is the master of the body. The body is the instrument
      of the soul. The soul is not a slave of the body; the body is the slave of the soul. The soul
      is the king, the body is the palace. The soul is the rider, the body is the horse.
