    <h1>The Soul and God</h1>
    <p>
      The soul is the innermost reality of man. It is the Atman, the Self. It is the witness of the
      three states of consciousness â€” waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. It is beyond the body, the
      mind, and the intellect. It is the eternal, the immortal, the changeless. The soul is one with
      God.
