<h2>TO MY OWN SOUL</h2>
<p class="center">(Composed at Ridgely Manor, New York, in
1899.)</p>
<p class="poem">Hold yet a while, Strong Heart, <br>
Not part a lifelong yoke <br>
Though blighted looks the present, future gloom. </p>
<p class="poem">And age it seems since you and I began our
<br>
March up hill or down. Sailing smooth o'er <br>
Seas that are so rare &#8212; <br>
Thou nearer unto me, than oft-times I myself &#8212; <br>
Proclaiming mental moves before they were! </p>
<p class="poem">Reflector true &#8212; Thy pulse so timed to
mine, <br>
Thou perfect note of thoughts, however fine &#8212; <br>
Shall we now part, Recorder, say? </p>
<p class="poem">In thee is friendship, faith, <br>
For thou didst warn when evil thoughts were brewing &#8212; <br>
And though, alas, thy warning thrown away, <br>
Went on the same as ever &#8212; good and true.</p>
