    <h1>The East and The West</h1>
    <p>
      The soul of the East is spirituality. The soul of the West is activity. The East is the land
      of contemplation, the West is the land of action. The East is the land of religion, the West
      is the land of science. The East is the land of the Vedas, the West is the land of the Bible.
