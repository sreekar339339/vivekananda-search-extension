    <h1>The Ideal of a Universal Religion</h1>
    <p>
      The human soul is eternal and immortal, perfect and infinite, and death means only a change of
      centre from one body to another. The present is determined by our past actions, and the future
      by the present. The soul will go on evolving up or reverting down from birth to birth and
      death to death.
