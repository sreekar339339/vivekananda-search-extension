# Playwright Best Practices

## Configuration

- Centralize settings in `playwright.config.js`.
- Use custom projects for multi-browser testing.
- Set environment-specific settings with `use` options.

## Use Options

- Set `headless` to `true` or `false` based on need.
- Customize `viewport` size and `userAgent` for different testing scenarios.

## Fixtures and Setup

- Use `fixtures` to manage resources, like database connections.
- Use `globalSetup` and `globalTeardown` for prep and cleanup.

## Parallelization

- Enable parallel test execution with workers.
- Use `grep` in CLI for selective test runs.

## Best Practices

- Write clear and meaningful test titles.
- Use resilient selectors (`data-testid`, etc.).
- Leverage retries for flaky tests but investigate root causes.

## Debugging

- Use `--debug` flag and Playwright Inspector for debugging.
- Capture screenshots and videos to understand failures.

## Browser-Specific Testing

- Use projects to test across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- Incorporate browser extensions with special configurations.
